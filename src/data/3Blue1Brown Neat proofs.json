What about all the lighthouses on the far end?  Well, a more careful calculation will show that the contributions from those lights become more negligible.  In fact, the contributions from almost all lights become negligible.  For the ambitious among you, see this paper for full details.\n\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".

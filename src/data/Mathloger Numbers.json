    "description" : "You probably know that nature is crawling with the Fibonacci numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc. But have you ever seen a simple explanation for this phenomenon? This video is the result of my own quest to distill a really accessible explanation from existing research. \n\nEnjoy :)\n\nIn the last video on continued fractions I mentioned that part of the explanation involves the golden ratio and the fact that this number is the most irrational number. I'll talk about this in a follow-up video. If you cannot wait check out this website: http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibnat2.html\nAlso check out the following video produced as part of research by Douady and Couder about how simple displacement at the center of a plant gives rise to Fibonacci numbers of spirals\nhttps://youtu.be/U-at-y3MicE\nThe paper itself can be found here https://www.math.ntnu.no/~jarlet/Douady96.pdf\nAnother very interesting approach by Levitov involves a magnetic cactus, vortices in superconductors and the fabulous Farey numbers: http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-phyllotaxis#2",

Two ways to support Mathologer \nMathologer Patreon:  https://www.patreon.com/mathologer\nMathologer PayPal: paypal.me/mathologer\n(see the Patreon page for details)\n\nThis video is my best shot at animating and explaining my favourite proof that pi is irrational.  It is due to the Swiss mathematician Johann Lambert who published it over 250 years ago. \n\nThe original write-up by Lambert is 58 pages long and definitely not for the faint of heart (http://www.kuttaka.org/~JHL/L1768b.pdf).  On the other hand, among all the proofs of the irrationality of pi, Lambert's proof is probably the most \"natural\" one, the one that's easiest to motivate and explain, and one that's ideally suited for the sort of animations that I do. \n\nAnyway it's been an absolute killer to put this video together and overall this is probably the most ambitious topic I've tackled so far. I really hope that a lot of you will get something out of it. If you do please let me know :) Also, as usual, please consider contributing subtitles in your native language (English and Russian are under control, but everything else goes). \n\nOne of the best short versions of Lambert's proof is contained in the book Autour du nombre pi by Jean-Pierre Lafon and Pierre Eymard. In particular, in it the authors calculate an explicit formula for the n-th partial fraction of Lambert's tan x formula; here is a scan with some highlighting by me: http://www.qedcat.com/misc/chopped.png\nHave a close look and you'll see that as n goes to infinity all the highlighted terms approach 1. What's left are the Maclaurin series for sin x on top and that for cos x at the bottom and this then goes a long way towards showing that those partial fractions really tend to tan x.\n\nThere is a good summary of other proofs for the irrationality of pi on this wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_π_is_irrational\n\nToday's main t-shirt I got from from Zazzle: \nhttps://www.zazzle.com.au/25_dec_31_oct_t_shirt-235809979886007646\n(there are lots of places that sell \"HO cubed\" t-shirts) \n \nlf you liked this video maybe also consider checking out some of my other videos on irrational and transcendental numbers and on continued fractions and other infinite expressions. The video on continued fractions that I refer to in this video is my video on the most irrational number: https://youtu.be/CaasbfdJdJg\n\nSpecial thanks to my friend Marty Ross for lots of feedback on the slideshow and some good-humoured heckling while we were recording the video. Thank you also to Danil Dimitriev for his ongoing Russian support of this channel.\n\nMerry Christmas!",

    "description" : "NEW (Christmas 2019). Two ways to support Mathologer \nMathologer Patreon:  https://www.patreon.com/mathologer\nMathologer PayPal: paypal.me/mathologer\n(see the Patreon page for details)\n\nGet ready for some brand new and very pretty visual proofs of the fact that root 2, root 3, root 5 and root 6 are irrational numbers. \n\nRoot 2 being irrational also translates into the fact that the equation  x^2+x^2=y^2 has no solutions in positive integers, root 3 being irrational translates into the fact that the equation  x^2+x^2+x^2=y^2 has no solutions in positive integers, etc. \n\nWhat I find very attractive about these proofs is that the destructive core of these proofs by contradiction lead a second secret constructive life, giving birth to infinitely many nearest miss solutions of our impossible equations like for example 15^2+15^2+15^2=26^2-1.\n\nHere is the paper by Steven J. Miller and David Montague which features the basic root 3 and pentagonal root 5 choreographies.\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4913\n\nFootnotes: \n-our nearest miss solutions like, for example, \n15^2+15^2+15^2=26^2-1\ncorrespond to the solutions of the equation y^2 - n x^2 = 1 with n=2, 3, 5 and 6. This is the famous Pell's equation, which happens to have solutions for all integers n that are not squares. \n-there is also a second type of nearest miss solutions like \n4^2+4^2+4^2=7^2+1 (a plus instead of a minus at the end). Starting with one of these our choreographies also generate all other such nearest misses. \n-the original Tennenbaum square choreography and the first puzzle root three choreography generate both types of nearest misses from any nearest miss solution.\n-The close approximations to the various roots corresponding to our nearest miss solutions are partial fractions of the continued fraction expansion of the roots.\n-lots more things to be said here but we are getting close to the word limit for descriptions and so I better stop :)\n\nThank you very much to Marty for all his nitpicking of the script for this video and Danil for his ongoing Russian support. \n\nToday's t-shirt is the amazing square root t-shirt (google \"square root tshirt\"). Note that the tree looks like a square root sign AND that the roots of the tree are really square. \n\nEnjoy!",

Find out about how the usual suspects root 2, e, and pi stack up against this special number and where the irrationality of this special number materialises in nature.\n\nAnother video to check out is this leisurely lecture by Professor John Barrow: https://youtu.be/zCFF1l7NzVQ and his write-up in Plus+ magazine: https://plus.maths.org/content/chaos-numberland-secret-life-continued-fractions\nIf you are reasonably clued up mathwise have a look at the following VERY nice textbook chapter on infinite fractions by Professor Paul Loya from Binghampton University: http://www.math.binghamton.edu/dikran/478/Ch7.pdf  In particular, check out section 7.5.1. The mystery of π and good and best approximations. I use the definition of \"best rational approximation\" given there. And if you are okay with all this and are having transcendental numbers for breakfast, definitely also don't miss out on the last section 7.10. Epilogue: Transcendental numbers, π, e, and where’s calculus?\n\nEnjoy :)",

Two ways to support Mathologer \nMathologer Patreon:  https://www.patreon.com/mathologer\nMathologer PayPal: paypal.me/mathologer\n(see the Patreon page for details)\n\nFor this Christmas video the Mathologer sets out to explain Euler's identity e to the pi i = -1, the most beautiful identity in math to our clueless friend Homer Simpson. Very challenging to get this right since Homer knows close to no math!\n\nHere are a couple of other nice videos on Euler's identity that you may want to check out:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Yi3bT-82O5s (one of our Math in the Simpsons videos)\nhttps://youtu.be/F_0yfvm0UoU   (by 3Blue1Brown)\n\nAnd for those of you who enjoy some mathematical challenges here is your homework assignment on Euler's identity:\n1. How much money does Homer have after Pi years if interest is compounded continuously?\n2. How much money does Homer have after an imaginary Pi number of years?\n3. As we've seen when you let m go to infinity the function (1+x/m)^m turns into the exponential function. In fact, it turns into the infinite series expansion of the exponential function that we used in our previous video. Can you explain why?\n4. Can you explain the e to pi i paradox that we've captured in this video on Mathologer 2: https://youtu.be/Sx5_QGdFmq4.\n\nIf you own Mathematica you can play with this Mathematica notebook that I put together for this video\nhttp://www.qedcat.com/misc/Mathologer_eipi.nb\n\nThank you very much to Danil Dmitriev the official Mathologer translator for Russian for his subtitles.\n\nMerry Christmas!",

    "description" : "NEW (Christmas 2019). Two ways to support Mathologer \nMathologer Patreon:  https://www.patreon.com/mathologer\nMathologer PayPal: paypal.me/mathologer\n(see the Patreon page for details)\n\nThe good old times tables lead a very exciting secret life involving the infamous Mandelbrot set, the ubiquitous cardioid and a myriad of hidden beautiful patterns. Time for the Mathologer to go on a serious fact-finding mission.\n\nFor those of you who’d like to play around a bit with the stunning times table diagrams that we discuss in this video, download the .cdf file http://www.qedcat.com/cardioid.cdf  and open it with the free cdf player which you can download from Wolfram Research (the people behind Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica). If you have access to Mathematica you can also open my .cdf file in Mathematica and play with the code.\n \nFor those of you who are looking for a bit of a challenge, ponder this:\n1) Starting with the fact that the nephroid arises from parallel rays being reflected inside a cylindrical coffee cup, try to convince yourself that the 3 times table really does produce the nephroid (some really neat geometry at work here, very similar to the argument for the cardioid that I talk about at the end of the video). (Added 8 November 2015 check out the proof at http://www.qedcat.com/nephroid_proof.pdf )\n2) Why do the diagrams for all the times tables have a horizontal mirror symmetry?\n3) Try to explain the pretty patterns corresponding to the 51 and 99 times tables modulo 200 that I display in the video (around the 9:30 mark).\n4) (For those of you with a very strong math background) Try to figure out why the cardioid shows up in the Mandelbrot set.\n\nThe discovery of the stunning patterns that I discuss in this video is due to the mathematician Simon Plouffe. Check out this article  http://tinyurl.com/o2hbtsa and his website http://plouffe.fr for other stunning visualisations using modular arithmetic.\n\nQuite a few animations have been contributed by various people and linked to in the comments: Here is one of the nicest ones by Mathias Lengler:\nhttps://mathiaslengler.github.io/TimesTableWebGL/\n\nEnjoy!\n\nP.S.: The music we are playing at the end is called Shoulder Closure by Gunnar Olsen. It's part of the free YouTube music library. A really nice piece , isn't it?",

    "description" : "The Mathologer sets out to make sense of 1+2+3+ ... = -1/12 and some of those other notorious, crazy-looking infinite sum identities. The starting point for this video is the famous letter that led to the discovery of self-taught mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan in 1913 (Ramanujan is the subject of the movie \"The man who knew infinity\" that just started showing in cinemas.) Find out about how these identities come up in Ramanujan's work, the role of \"just do it\" in math, the rules for adding infinite sums on Earth and other worlds, and what all this has to do with the mathematical super star the Riemann Zeta function.\n\nYou can download the jpeg of Ramanujan's letter to Hardy that I put together for this video here: http://www.qedcat.com/misc/ramanujans_letter.jpg\n(quite large)\nYou can access a scanned copy of Ramanujan's notebook here: http://http://www.imsc.res.in/~rao/ramanujan/NoteBooks/NoteBook1/chapterVIII/page3.htm\nor check this out\nhttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Of5G0r6DQiEC&pg=PA53&dq=gratified&redir_esc=y&hl=en#v=onepage&q=gratified&f=false\n\nIf you want to watch some other videos that deal with these strange identities I recommend the following: \nhttps://youtu.be/0Oazb7IWzbA (a Numberphile video featuring the mathematician Edward Frenkel who is also talking about the connection between the Riemann Zeta function and Ramanujan's crazy identity.) \nhttps://youtu.be/8hgeIDY7We4 (James Grime's video (singingbanana & Numberphile) which aims at making sense of the  formula at the heart of Ramanujan summation which I only flash briefly in the last part of the video.)\nhttps://youtu.be/XFDM1ip5HdU (a very nice 3Blue1Brown video that makes sense of the identity 1+2+4+8+ ... = –1 in a way that is totally different from the one I am talking about in this video.)\n\nThis week’s video is in response to a large number of you and my students at university asking me for my take on the whole 1+2+3+... =-1/12 business. Initially, the plan was to come up with one of my usual 15 minute long videos. However, after several unsuccessful attempts at not exceeding the magic Mathologer time limit, I realised that any “short” video like this would just be a clone of one of those wrong/misleading accounts of this topic that YouTube is full of. So, rather than just give up completely on this project I decided to do what you should never do if you actually want people to watch your videos, namely simply go for it and not look at the clock. The result – a video that is an insane 35 minutes long in which I say all the things that I think need to be said and can be said only using elementary math to (just barely) do this amazing topic justice. \n\nThank you very much to Danil Dmitriev the official Mathologer translator for Russian for his subtitles.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nP.S.: If you know calculus and want to read up on all this some more, beyond what is readily available via the relevant Wiki pages and other internet resources, I recommend you read the last chapter of the book by Konrad Knopp, Theory and applications of infinite series, Dover books, 1990 (actually if you know German, read the extended version of this chapter in the  original 1924 edition of the book). People usually recommend Hardy's book, Divergent series, but I'd say only look at this after you've looked at Knopp's book which I find a lot more accessible. The Hardy who wrote this book is the Hardy who I mention at the beginning of the video! Having said that, Hardy's book does have quite a bit of detail on how Ramanujan summation applies to the Zeta function; see chapters 13.10. and 13.17.",

Two ways to support Mathologer \nMathologer Patreon:  https://www.patreon.com/mathologer\nMathologer PayPal: paypal.me/mathologer\n(see the Patreon page for details)\n\nThe longest Mathologer video ever! 50 minutes, will this work? Let's see before I get really serious about that Kurosawa length Galois theory video :)\n\nToday's video is another self-contained story of mathematical discovery covering millennia of math, starting from pretty much nothing and finishing with a mathematical mega weapon that usually only real specialists dare to touch. I worked really hard on this one. Fingers crossed that after all this work the video now works for you :) Anyway, lots of things to look forward to: a ton of power sum formulas, animations of a couple of my favourite “proofs without words”, the mysterious Bernoulli numbers (the numbers to \"rule them all\" as far as power sums go), the (hopefully) most accessible introduction to the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula ever, and much more.\n\nHere is a link to a couple of slides that show how to justify having all summations in sight run from 1 to n. This is the challenge that follows the discussion at https://youtu.be/fw1kRz83Fj0?t=2440 . Had this in the video originally and then decided to make this into a challenge: http://www.qedcat.com/misc/change_limits.pdf\n\nAs usual thank you very much to my friend Marty Ross for nitpicking this one to death (especially for not letting off until I finally inserted that \"morph\" shortcut in chapter 7 :)\n\nFinally, check out the article \"Gauss’s Day of Reckoning\" by Brian Hayes which tells the story behind the famous story of Gauss adding 1+2+3+...+100 as a kid: https://tinyurl.com/y49buyak\n\nEnjoy :)",

Two ways to support Mathologer \nMathologer Patreon:  https://www.patreon.com/mathologer\nMathologer PayPal: paypal.me/mathologer\n(see the Patreon page for details)\n\nLeibniz's formula pi/4 = 1-1/3+1/5-1/7+... is one of the most iconic pi formulas. It is also one of the most surprising when you first encounter it. Why? Well, usually when we see pi we expect a circle close-by. And there is definitely no circle in sight anywhere here, just the odd numbers combining in a magical way into pi. However, if you look hard enough you can discover a huge circle at the core of this formula. \n\nHere is a link to the relevant chapter in Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen's book Geometry and the Imagination (Google books). I am pretty sure that the idea and proof for the circle proof of the Leibniz formula that I mathologerise in this video first appeared in this book and is due to the authors: https://books.google.com.au/books?id=7WY5AAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA44&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\nHere is a link to a video in which 3blue1brown about the same hidden circle in Leibniz formula:\nhttps://youtu.be/NaL_Cb42WyY\nAnd another video by him about a hidden circle in the solution to the Basel problem: \nhttps://youtu.be/d-o3eB9sfls\n\nThere is also a neat generalisation to what we talked about in this video to the solution of the Basel problem - in terms of the lattice points in a 4-dimensional sphere and the 4-square counterpart of the 4(good-bad) theorem. If you are interested in some details have a look at the last proof in this write-up by Robin Chapman: https://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/rjchapma/etc/zeta2.pdf \n\nLinks to two Numberphile videos about the one-sentence proof by Don Zagier featuring Matthias Kreck: https://youtu.be/SyJlRUBoVp0 (intro), https://youtu.be/yGsIw8LHXM8 (the math)\n\nLink to the original Jodocus Hondius engraving of Jodocus Hondius that Google tries to pass of as a portrait of the mathematician Albert Girard\nhttps://www.swaen.com/zoomV5e.php?id=8653&referer=antique-map-of.php\n\nThank you very much to Marty for all his help with polishing the script of the video and Karl for his idea for the 2019 Easter egg. \n\nToday's t-shirt: google \"spreadshirt pi+tree+christmas+math\"\n\nEnjoy :)",
